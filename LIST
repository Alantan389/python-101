Modify short_names by deleting the first element and changing the last element to Joe.

Sample output with input: 'Gertrude Sam Ann Joseph'
['Sam', 'Ann', 'Joe']


user_input = input()
short_names = user_input.split()

''' Your solution goes here '''

if len(short_names) > 1:
    short_names.pop(0)  # Removes the first element
    short_names[-1] = 'Joe'  # Changes the last element to 'Joe'
elif len(short_names) == 1:
    short_names[0] = 'Joe' 


print(short_names)

The following (unfinished) program implements a digital line queuing system for an amusement park ride. The system allows a rider to reserve a place in line without actually having to wait. The rider simply enters a name into a program to reserve a place. Riders that purchase a VIP pass get to skip past the common riders up to the last VIP rider in line. VIPs board the ride first. (Considering the average wait time for a Disneyland ride is about 45 minutes, this might be a useful program.) For this system, an employee manually selects when the ride is dispatched (thus removing the next riders from the front of the line).

Complete the following program, as described above. Once finished, add the following commands:

The rider can enter a name to find the current position in line. (Hint: Use the list.index() method.)
The rider can enter a name to remove the rider from the line.


riders_per_ride = 3  # Number of riders per ride to dispatch

line = []  # The line of riders
num_vips = 0  # Track number of VIPs at the front of the line

menu = ('(1) Reserve place in line.\n'  # Add rider to the regular line
        '(2) Reserve place in VIP line.\n'  # Add VIP
        '(3) Dispatch riders.\n'  # Dispatch next ride car
        '(4) Print riders.\n'
        '(5) Exit.\n\n')

user_input = input(menu).strip().lower()

while user_input != '5':
    if user_input == '1':  # Add rider to the regular line
        name = input('Enter name: ').strip().lower()
        line.append(name)
        print(f'{name} added to the regular line.')

    elif user_input == '2':  # Add VIP
        name = input('Enter VIP name: ').strip().lower()
        line.insert(num_vips, name)  # Insert VIP at the current VIP position
        num_vips += 1  # Increment VIP count
        print(f'{name} added as a VIP.')

    elif user_input == '3':  # Dispatch riders
        if len(line) == 0:
            print('No riders to dispatch.')
        else:
            dispatch_count = min(riders_per_ride, len(line))  # Number of riders to dispatch
            dispatched = line[:dispatch_count]  # Riders to be removed
            line = line[dispatch_count:]  # Remaining riders in line
            num_vips = max(0, num_vips - dispatch_count)  # Adjust VIP count if VIPs were dispatched
            print(f'Dispatched: {dispatched}')

    elif user_input == '4':  # Print riders waiting in line
        if len(line) == 0:
            print('The line is empty.')
        else:
            print('{} person(s) waiting:'.format(len(line)), line)

    else:
        print('Unknown menu option.')

    # Prompt for the next input
    user_input = input('\nEnter command: ').strip().lower()

print('Goodbye!')

Each iteration of the loop creates a new variable by binding the next element of the list to the name my_var. The loop body statements execute during each iteration and can use the current value of my_var as necessary. 1

Programs commonly iterate through lists to determine some quantity about the list's items. Ex: The following program determines the value of the maximum even number in a list:

# User inputs string w/ numbers: '203 12 5 800 -10'
user_input = input('Enter numbers:')

tokens = user_input.split()  # Split into separate strings

# Convert strings to integers
nums = []
for token in tokens:
    nums.append(int(token))

# Print each position and number
print()  # Print a single newline
for index in range(len(nums)):
    value = nums[index]
    print('{}: {}'.format(index, value))

# Determine maximum even number
max_num = None
for num in nums:
    if (max_num == None) and (num % 2 == 0):
        # First even number found
        max_num = num
    elif (max_num != None) and (num > max_num ) and (num % 2 == 0):
        # Larger even number found
        max_num = num

print('Max even #:', max_num)
