count loop.  
### 


##### calculate the total negative number when input is 0
# Initialize count variable
count = 0

# Get the first input from the user
val = int(input("Enter a number (0 to stop): "))

# Loop until the user enters 0
while val != 0:
    # Check if the input value is negative
    if val < 0:
        count += 1  # Increment the counter for negative numbers
    
    # Get the next input
    val = int(input("Enter a number (it will not stop until input 0): "))

# Print the total count of negative numbers
print("Total number of negative values entered:", count)






##### calculate the max number when input is 0
# Initialize max to a value lower than any possible positive input
max = -1

# Get the first input
val = int(input("Enter a positive number (enter 0 when done): "))

while val != 0:
    # (A) Check if the current value is greater than max
    if val > max:
        # (B) Update max if it is
        max = val

    # Get the next input
    val = int(input("Enter next number (enter 0 when done): "))

print("The maximum value is:", max)


-----------------------------------------------------------
Write a while loop that prints user_num divided by 2 until user_num is less than 1. The value of user_num changes inside of the loop.

Sample output with input: 20
10.0
5.0
2.5
1.25
0.625


Note: If the submitted code has an infinite loop, 
the system will stop running the code after a few seconds and r
eport "Program end never reached.
" The system doesn't print the test case that caused the reported message.

code : 

user_num = int(input())

''' Your solution goes here '''

while user_num >= 1:
    
    value=user_num/2 
    print(value)
    user_num=value
